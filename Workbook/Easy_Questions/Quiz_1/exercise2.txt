Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 
If '!' or '?' is at the end of a method, it's part of the method name, and not Ruby syntax.

And explain what would happen in the following scenarios: 

1. what is != and where should you use it?
It an operator that means "not eaqual to".
You would use it in a conditional statement.

2. put ! before something, like !user_name
It's the 'not' operator. Again, you would use it in a conditional statement
like so: 
if !user_name
Better said: It's used to turn any object into the opposite of its boolean equivalent.

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
It's the bang (!) operator.  For many (but not all) methods, it can be added to the method name to change the method so it mutates the caller.

4. put ? before something
In this situation it would indicate it was being used as a ternary operator.

5. put ? after something
Generally means the method is checking for the existance of something

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
Used to turn any object into its boolean equivalent.
