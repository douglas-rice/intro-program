# Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and 
# last name as your full name in one string.

first_name = "Douglas"
last_name = "Rice"

# Solution using string concatenation:

puts first_name + " " + last_name

# Solution using string interpolation:

puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
